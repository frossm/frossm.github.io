<h1 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">INTRODUCTION</a></h1>
<p>RPNCalc is the command-line based Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator.  RPN calculators make it very simple to do complex calculations, especially if there are parentheses involved.  For a quick example, consider solving for x with the following:</p>
<p><code>x = SQRT((((5+3) * 8)/2) ^ 6)</code></p>
<p>This can be tricky with a traditional calculator.  However, with a RPN Calculator, to solve for x you would start on the inner calculation and work outwards by entering the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>5</code></li>
<li><code>3</code></li>
<li><code>+</code></li>
<li><code>8</code></li>
<li><code>*</code></li>
<li><code>2</code></li>
<li><code>/</code></li>
<li><code>6</code></li>
<li><code>^</code></li>
<li><code>SQRT</code></li>
</ul>
<p>(This can also be dramatically shortened using the <code>NumOps</code> shortcut - see the <code>Operands</code> chapter)</p>
<p>RPN is based on a Last In First Out (LIFO) stack framework which sounds complicated, but makes intuitive sense when you use it.  On a RPN calculator, there is no equal sign, but there is an enter key to put a value onto the stack.</p>
<p>So, in the above example, when you enter <strong><code>5 [ENTER]</code></strong> , 5 is put on top of the stack.  You then enter <strong><code>3 [ENTER]</code></strong> which add that to the top.  5 is pushed down to 2nd.  When <strong><code>+</code></strong> is entered, the top two stack items are removed from the stack, added, and the result is placed on the top.  I'll talk more about stacks and how RPNCalc uses them in future chapters.</p>
<p>If you have not heard of reverse Polish notation, or just have a passion for various calculator notations (and seriously, who doesn't?), you can read more about RPN on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<img align="right" width="150" src ="https://github.com/frossm/rpncalc/raw/master/graphics/PostIt-200x200.jpg">
<p>Over the years I've used various RPN calculators, but I failed to find a simple command line version that I liked.  Therefore, I decided to write one back in 2011.  One key goal was to make it extensible so I could easily add new features, constants, and capabilities.  A second goal was to allow it to run everywhere I needed it to run, which is mostly Windows and Linux.  Therefore it's written in Java, it should run just about anywhere Java is supported.  And, while this calculator doesn't have <em><strong>every</strong></em> function a complex calculator would have, it has the basics covered.</p>
<p>If there are ideas, suggestions, or complaints, drop me an email at RPNCalc@fross.org or leave a comment in the GitHub issues tracker.  I am continually adding new capabilities to it when the need arises.</p>

<h1 id="installation"><a class="header" href="#installation">Installation</a></h1>
<p>There are two ways to install RPNCalc.  The first is simply download <code>rpncalc.jar</code> file from the latest release on <a href="https://github.com/frossm/rpncalc">GitHub</a>.  I have embedded all of the dependencies into this one file and it is directly executable.  You do not need to install anything.  Of course, you will need a java runtime (JRE) installed in your path. </p>
<p>The second is to run it as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(software)">Snap</a>.  There are many advantages to using it as a snap and I'll get into that in the SNAP secion of this user guide.  My personal preference is install it via Snap.  No Java to worry about, I'm protected as it runs in a sandbox, no aliases needed, always kept up to date, etc.</p>
<h2 id="standard-installation"><a class="header" href="#standard-installation">Standard Installation</a></h2>
<p>Please note that I only have the ability to test it in Windows and Linux (Ubuntu). While I don't think there would be issues on other platforms, it's something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>To run RPNCalc use the following command:</p>
<p><code>java -jar /path/to/rpncalc.jar</code></p>
<p>This is much too long to type every time you need to run it, so I simply create an alias.  Here is example from the Bash shell:</p>
<p><code>alias rpncalc='java -jar /path/to/rpncalc.jar</code></p>
<h4 id="standard-uninstall"><a class="header" href="#standard-uninstall">Standard Uninstall</a></h4>
<p>If you wish to uninstall RPNCalc, just delete the file.  Easy and simple.</p>
<p>However, RPNCalc does use the Java preferences to store data.  It's located in different places depending on the OS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows keeps it in the registry <code>(HKCU\Software\JavaSoft\Prefs)</code></li>
<li>Linux in a hidden directory in your home folder <code>(~/.java/userPrefs)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>It is very small and removing it is not really necessary, but if you like to keep things tidy, delete the <code>org.fross.rpn</code> entry in the preference system.</p>
<h2 id="snap-installation"><a class="header" href="#snap-installation">Snap Installation</a></h2>
<p>If you are on a Linux system and have Snap installed (it's comes default on most Ubuntu based distributions, but can be installed by most others), you can install RPNCalc as a snap.  It does not require any special snap permissions.  To install via snap use:</p>
<p><code>sudo snap install rpncalc</code></p>
<p>To run it after installation, simply execute:</p>
<p><code>rpncalc</code></p>
<h4 id="snap-uninstall"><a class="header" href="#snap-uninstall">Snap Uninstall</a></h4>
<p>To uninstall, execute the following command:</p>
<p><code>sudo snap remove rpncalc</code></p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><img align="right" width="125" src="Chapters/../Images/HighLevelUsage.png">
<h1 id="high-level-usage"><a class="header" href="#high-level-usage">High Level Usage</a></h1>
<p>RPNCalc is a command line application that must be run from a console / command prompt.  Executing it with a <code>-h</code> (or <code>-?</code>) switch, or starting the program and entering the <code>h</code> command will display the in-program help page.  This page lists all of the commands and operands that can be used, but it is fairly terse  This can be viewed at the bottom of the <code>Introduction</code> page of this guide. This document is meant as a more comprehensive guide.</p>
<p>There are various command line switches that can be used when starting the program as are detailed in the <code>Command Line Options</code> page.  They generally exist so that aliases can be used to control several key parameters.</p>
<p>Once inside the program, you'll be presented a prompt where numbers, operands, and commands may be entered.  Numbers will be added to the stack which you can think of a stack of plates.  The top stack item (represented by <code>line1</code> in the program).  You can think of this stack of plates as a Last In First Out (LIFO) arrangement.</p>
<p>For example, you could enter <code>2 [ENTER]</code> it would be in the <code>line1</code> position and would be on the top of the stack.  If you then enter <code>3 [ENTER]</code> the <code>2</code> would move up and the <code>3</code> would then be on <code>line1</code> and be on the top of the stack.  You can then enter in an operand, such as <code>+</code> to perform the action on the items opn the top of the stack.  To continue our example, pressing <code>+ [ENTER]</code> would take the top two items off of the stack, add them, and put the result back on top of the stack.</p>
<p>I'll go into a bit more detail below on using stacks, but it's fairly easy and intutive.  Once you get the hang of it, you'll regret having to use a standard calculator in the future.</p>
<h3 id="decimals--fractions"><a class="header" href="#decimals--fractions">Decimals &amp; Fractions</a></h3>
<p>In RPNCalc, the stacks always store numbers as decimals.  You can, however, enter in fractions and they will be instantly converted to a decimal equivalent and added to the stack.  The original fraction you entered is lost in the conversion.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><code>1 5/16 [ENTER]</code> </p>
<p>will add <code>1.3125</code> to the top of the stack (<code>line1</code>)</p>
<p><code>14/8 [ENTER]</code> </p>
<p>will add <code>1.75</code> to the stack</p>
<p>While you can never directly convert a decimal number on the stack back to a fraction, you can display an approximation of what the last stack item would be as a fraction.  You do have to decide on the smallest denominator that will be used (called the base.)  The default base is <code>64</code> which is the equivalent of <code>1/64</code> and will be used if none is specified.  Use the <code>frac [base]</code> command to display the approximate fractional equivalent.  RPNCalc will simplify the fraction as much as it can so you won't see <code>2/4</code> as a fraction, you'd see <code>1/2</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
<code>12.3456 [Enter]</code>
<code>frac [Enter]</code></p>
<p>Will display <code>12 11/32</code>  RPNCalc converted it to <code>12 22/64</code> and then reduced it.</p>
<p><code>1 3/64 [Enter]</code>
<code>frac 16 [Enter]</code></p>
<p>will display <code>1 1/16</code> as that's as close as it could get with a granularity of 1/16.</p>
<p><code>1 3/64 [ENTER]</code>
<code>frac 100000</code></p>
<p>will display <code>1 293/6250</code>.  This is a closer approximation than using base 16.</p>
<h2 id="operands-numbers-and-commands"><a class="header" href="#operands-numbers-and-commands">Operands, Numbers, and Commands</a></h2>
<p>Numbers, whether decimal or fractions, can be entered on the command line and they get added to the stack.  That's fairly self explanatory.</p>
<p>Operands perform basic match functions on those numbers.</p>
<p>Commands do the more exciting things.  You can add the speed of light constant to the stack (<code>sol</code>) or PI (<code>pi</code>), take the sine of the number, add it to a memory slot, and then save that as a user defined function.  Most of the rest of this guide will be talking about the various RPNCalc commands.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><img align="right" width="200" src="Chapters/../Images/Plates.png">
<h1 id="stacks"><a class="header" href="#stacks">Stacks</a></h1>
<p>The entire concept of a RPN calculator is based on a stack, which can be thoughts of as numbers stacked on top of each other.  You add numbers to the stack and they are normally processed Last In First Out (LIFO). </p>
<p>With RPNCalc, when you leave the program, the current (and secondary) stacks are saved.  If you didn't specify a named stack,  the <code>default</code> stack is used.  When you start the program you can specify which stack to load with the <code>-l</code> command.  If none is entered, the <code>default</code> stack is loaded.  You may also load / create a new stack inside of the program with the <code>load</code> command.</p>
<p>When you perform calculations or commands, they generally work from the top of the stack down.  In RPNCalc, the top of the stack is <code>line1</code> and it's actually at the bottom of the display.  When you perform calculations, you are working on your command line and the lines above you.  This might be a bit hard to visualize, but makes a lot of sense when you actually use the calculator.  Trust me.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to take the square root of 25, you enter <code>25 [ENTER]</code> and it will be added to the top of the stack at <code>line1</code>.  Then execute the command <code>SQRT [ENTER]</code>.  This will remove 25 from the stack on <code>line1</code>, perform the square root, then place the result <code>5</code> back onto the stack.  Some operations require more than one stack item.  The math <code>add</code> function, for example, will take the last two numbers off the stack, add them together, and then place the result on the stack.</p>
<p>The order of the numbers on the stack is important for some of the operands.  This is detailed out in the <code>Operand</code> chapter.</p>

<p>Saving and loading stacks is fundamental to RPNCalc.  You can have as many named stacks as you like.  They are stored in the Java Preferences location which varies by OS:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>OS</th><th>Location</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Windows</td><td>Stored in the current user hive of the registry at<code>(HKCU\Software\JavaSoft\Prefs\org\fross\rpn)</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Linux</td><td>Linux uses the .java directory in your home directory</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mac</td><td>The preferences files are named <code>com.apple.java.util.prefs</code> are are stored in their home directory at <code>~/Library/Preferences</code>.  I don't have a Mac and this was sources from the internet.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>It is safe to delete these if you wish to stay tidy, but of course you'll lose any saved stacks, memory slots, and user defined functions which are stored there.  They will be recreated again when RPNCalc is started.</p>
<p>Each stack you load (default or a named stack) actually has 2 internal stacks defined; a primary and secondary.  You can quickly swap stacks using the swap stack <code>ss</code> command.  For example, you are working on something and need to do a few calculations that you wish to keep separate from your main work.  You can swap stacks, do the work, then swap back.  They do not communicate in any way and are distinctly separate.  The primary and secondadry stack data is saved and restored upon loading the stack.</p>
<p>When you start up RPNCalc, you can load a named stack with the <code>-l name</code> command.  If the stack <code>name</code> exists, it will be loaded.  If it does not exist, the stack will be created and when you leave the program it will be saved.  You can always view what stack you are using in the lower right of the dashed bar. The <code>:1</code> or <code>:2</code> after the stack name will tell you if you are on the primary or secondary stack.</p>
<p>As a side note, both stacks and memory slots are saved during shutdown.  While the data in a stack is specific to that stack, memory slots are global.  The default stack items are restored at startup (or whatever stack you choose to load with <code>-l name</code>.)  Memory slots are also restored at startup.  <code>list mem</code> will show the values in current memory, and <code>list stacks</code> will show the saved stacks available to load.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong><code>Please note that the undo functionality is shared (and shouldn't be) so you could undo on one stack and restore the other.  I'm looking into correcting this or perhaps removing the secondary stack as I'm not sure how much it's being used</code></strong></em></p>

<h1 id="command-line-options"><a class="header" href="#command-line-options">Command Line Options</a></h1>
<p>Currently there are several command line options, and all are optional.  Normally, one would simply run the program and you would enter in numbers, operands, and commands.</p>
<p>However, there are several options that can be set when the program is executed.  If you always want to run RPNCalc with a specific command line option, you should create an alias in your shell to do so.  Then ever time you run rpncalc, it would run with those options.</p>
<p>You can set the number of memory slots, decimal alignment, debug mode, and others via these options.  The below table lists all of the allowed command line options and their functions.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Option</th><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>-D</td><td><code>DEBUG MODE</code></td><td>Runs the program in debug mode.  This will display quite a bit of information in RED as you use the program.  This is mostly used by the developer and clutters everythign up, but you may find it useful if you are trying to debug something.  I could certainly add a lot more if needed, but it's useful today.  You can also toggle debug mode on/off by entering in the command <code>debug</code> while within the program - you don't have to restart RPNCalc</td></tr>
<tr><td>-l name</td><td><code>LOAD STACK</code></td><td>Load a saved stack.  This essentially will &quot;name&quot; your session and store the stack upon exit in the Java preferences system.  You can load the stack with the <code>-l name</code> command line option, or from within the program by using the <code>load name</code> command.  Please note the name field is whatever you want to call the instance but avoid spaces in the name.  I'm not aware of a limit to the number of saved stacks You can have.  If the name to load does not exist, the stack will be created and saved when you exit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>-a l <br> -a d <br> -a r</td><td><code>ALIGNMENT</code></td><td>This option sets the display alignment of the numbers on the stack. Alignment can either be an <code>-a l</code> for LEFT alignment, an <code>-a r</code> for RIGHT alignment, or a <code>-a d</code> to align to the decimal point.  This impacts the display only and doesn't impact the calculations.  For example, when I load my saved stack <code>-l checkbook</code>, I align by decimal which makes it a bit easier to read a stack with only two decimal place numbers.  Alignments can also be changed within the program itself using the <code>a</code> command</td></tr>
<tr><td>-m [slots]</td><td><code>MEMORY SLOTS</code></td><td>Override the default of ten available memory slots.  If you need 25 memory slots, just use <code>-m 25</code> when starting the program.  Please note that if you have 25 slots, the slot numbers within the program will be 0 - 24.  Slots are saved and restored between sessions, but if you run the program again and do not specify <code>-m 25</code>, it will default to 10 and you'll lose the memory slots greater than that.  If this is important, define an alias</td></tr>
<tr><td>-w width</td><td><code>WIDTH</code></td><td>Set the width of the program header and status line.  Default is 80 characters. Useful if you are using a very small terminal.  The minimum width of the console is currently 46 characters and RPNCalc will adjust to that if a lesser number is provided</td></tr>
<tr><td>-z</td><td><code>DISABLE COLOR</code></td><td>Disable colorized output.  Useful if your current terminal doesn't support ANSI color sequences</td></tr>
<tr><td>-v</td><td><code>VERSION</code></td><td>This will display the current program version, but will also check GitHub for the leatest release.  It is possible, especially if you are using RPNCalc as a Snap, to have a later version than the latest GitHub release.</td></tr>
<tr><td>-h or -?</td><td><code>HELP</code></td><td>Display the program help page and exit.  This is the same as the <code>h</code> or <code>help</code> command within RPNCalc</td></tr>

<h1 id="operands"><a class="header" href="#operands">Operands</a></h1>
<p>Operands are the standard symbols used for basic mathematics on numbers.  The following is the list of operands supported by RPNCalc.  These are also supported by the NumOps shortcut described below.</p>
<p>With the exception of the addition (<code>+</code>) and multiplication (<code>*</code>) operand the order is important.  It's faily intuitive when you look at it in the calculator, but refer to the following table if needed.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Operand</th><th>Math</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>+</td><td><code>ADDITION</code></td><td>Add <code>line2</code> and <code>line</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>-</td><td><code>SUBTRACTION</code></td><td>Subtract <code>line1</code> from <code>line2</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>*</td><td><code>MULTIPLICATION</code></td><td>Multiply <code>line1</code> and <code>line2</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>/</td><td><code>DIVISION</code></td><td>Divide <code>line2</code> by <code>line1</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>^</td><td><code>POWER</code></td><td>Take <code>line2</code> to the power of <code>line1</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><code>3</code> <code>[Enter]</code> <code>2</code> <code>[Enter]</code> <code>-</code>  will execute 3 - 2 and will yield <code>1</code></p>
<p><code>2</code> <code>[Enter]</code> <code>3</code> <code>[Enter]</code> <code>-</code> will execute 2 - 3 and will yield <code>-1</code></p>
<p>Hint: We'll discuss commands in later chapters, but the Swap command <code>s</code> will swap the top two items in the stack (<code>line1</code> and <code>line2</code>).  Swap will also swap any to line numbers provided.  Jump to the <code>Calculator Commands</code> chapter for more information.</p>
<h2 id="the-numops-shortcut"><a class="header" href="#the-numops-shortcut">The NumOps Shortcut</a></h2>
<p>RPNCalc has an important shortcut that can speed up your calculations.  You can append one of the above operands at the end of an entered number and the program will, behind the scenes, place the number on top of the stack (<code>line1</code>) and then execute the operand.  For example:</p>
<p><code>2 [ENTER]</code></p>
<p><code>3+ [ENTER]</code></p>
<p>When the second enter is pressed,  the two stack items will be removed, added together, and the result, <code>5</code>, will be added back.  It's the same as entering this the following  three commands:</p>
<p><code>2 [ENTER]</code></p>
<p><code>3 [ENTER]</code></p>
<p><code>+ [ENTER]</code></p>
<p>As an example of this NumOps shortcut, lets revisit our example from the introduction.</p>
<p><code>x = SQRT((((5+3) * 8)/2) ^ 6)</code></p>
<p>Leveraging the shortcut, this would become:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>5</code></li>
<li><code>3+</code></li>
<li><code>8*</code></li>
<li><code>2/</code></li>
<li><code>6^</code></li>
<li><code>SQRT</code></li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, if you were wondering the answer is 32,768.</p>
<p><em><strong>Please note that you can not use this NumOps shortcut with a fractional number entry</strong></em></p>

<p>We've discussed numbers, both fractional and decimal as well as operands that perform basic mathematical functions.  This chapter starts discussing commands which are the heart and soul of RPNCalc.</p>
<p>In Calculator commands, these are the basic commands that operations on the numbers on the stack.  Most are fairly simple and intutitive, but there are a few that are a bit odd.  I'm looking at you <code>dice</code>.</p>
<p>These commands, like the others you'll read about later, are executed by typing the command name, and any needed arguments into RPNCalc.  Often there are several different names and abreviations for the same command.  This is just to make it easier to remember.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Command</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>u [#]<br> undo [#]</td><td><strong>UNDO:</strong> By default, undo the last operation.  However, if an undo stack line number is given, as displayed in the <code>list undo</code> command, undo will restore the stack back to that step.  Please keep in mind that if you restore back to a previous undo state, later undo states will be discarded.  Typically, however, <code>u</code> undo is used to simply undo the previous action</td></tr>
<tr><td>f <br> flip</td><td><strong>FLIP SIGN:</strong> Flip the sign on the top stack item <code>line1</code>. This is effectively multiplying <code>line1</code> by -1</td></tr>
<tr><td>c <br> clear</td><td><strong>CLEAR:</strong> Clear the screen, and empty the current stack.  Memory data is retained and you can undo the clear with the <code>u</code> undo command</td></tr>
<tr><td>cl <br> clean</td><td><strong>CLEAN SCREEN:</strong> Clear the current screen, but keep the stack.  After cleaning, the stack will be displayed at the top of the screen.  Used to remove the clutter</td></tr>
<tr><td>d [#] <br> del [#] <br> drop [#]</td><td><strong>DELETE:</strong> Delete the number on the top of the stack (<code>line1</code>) or, optionally, deletes the line number provided</td></tr>
<tr><td>s [#] [#] <br> swap [#] [#]</td><td><strong>SWAP LINES:</strong> Without an argument, swap the top two stack items (<code>line1 &amp; line2</code>).  You can swap any two line numbers in your stack by providing the two line numbers</td></tr>
<tr><td>%</td><td><strong>PERCENT:</strong> Assumes <code>line1</code> contains a percent.  This converts that into a number by simply dividing that value by 100.  For example, if you want to take 50.123% of a number, you could just enter in <code>50.123 [ENTER] % [ENTER] *</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>sqrt</td><td><strong>SQUARE ROOT:</strong> Perform a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root">square root</a> of the top stack item (<code>line1</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>round [n]</td><td><strong>ROUND:</strong> Round <code>line1</code> to <code>[n]</code> decimal places.  If <code>[n]</code> is not given, round to the nearest integer (zero decimal places).  <strong>Example 1:</strong> <code>3.14159</code> <code>round</code> would round to <code>3</code>.  <strong>Example 2:</strong> <code>3.14159</code> <code>round 4</code> would round to <code>3.1416</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>aa [keep]</td><td><strong>ADD ALL:</strong> Add all stack items together and return the result to the stack.  If the optional <code>keep</code> parameter is sent, the elements added will be retained on the stack and the total will be added to the top of the stack.  The entire <code>keep</code> command is not necessary, anything that starts with <code>k</code> will work</td></tr>
<tr><td>mod</td><td><strong>MODULUS:</strong> <a href="Chapters/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic">Modulus</a> is the remainder after a division.  This command will perform a division of the top two stack items and return the remainder only back to the stack</td></tr>
<tr><td>avg [keep]</td><td><strong>AVERAGE:</strong> Calculate the average of all of the numbers on the stack.  The stack will be replaced with the result.  If <code>keep</code> is provided, the stack will be retained and the average will be added on top. <code>average</code> or <code>mean</code> can also be used</td></tr>
<tr><td>sd [keep]</td><td><strong>STANDARD DEVIATION:</strong> Calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">standard deviation</a> of the items in the stack.  The stack items will be replaced by the result. If <code>keep</code> is provided, the numbers on the stack will not be removed and the standard deviation will simply be added to the top of the stack on <code>line1</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>copy [#] <br> dup [#]</td><td><strong>COPY:</strong> With no number provided, copy will duplicate the top stack item / <code>line1</code> and place it on the stack.  If the optional line number is given, the value at the line will be duplicated to the top of the stack</td></tr>

<tr><td>int</td><td><strong>INTEGER:</strong> Converts the top stack item (<code>line1</code>) to it's integer value.  This will discard the decimal portion regardless of it's value.  For example: <code>4.34</code> will result in <code>4</code>.  <code>4.999</code> will also result in <code>4</code>. If rounding is desired, execute the <code>round</code> command prior to <code>int</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>abs</td><td><strong>ABSOLUTE VALUE:</strong> Takes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value#:%7E:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20the%20absolute%20value,and%20%7C0%7C%20%3D%200">absolute value</a> of line 1.

<h1 id="conversions"><a class="header" href="#conversions">Conversions</a></h1>
<p>The conversion commands will simply convert from one unit to another.  As an example, I frequently use RPNCalc to convert from inches to millimeters or back.</p>
<p>I've included the ones I use the most, but I'm happy to include others if you'd find something else useful.</p>
<h2 id="fractional-display"><a class="header" href="#fractional-display">Fractional Display</a></h2>
<p>The RPNCalc stack only contains decimal numbers.  Therefore, we can't directly store fractional values on the stack.  If a fraction is entered, it is converted to a decimal.  There could be a loss of percision when this is done.  For example, there is no exact fractional equivalent for <code>PI</code> much like there is no exact decimal equivalent for <code>1/3</code>.  However, the difference is usually so small that it's acceptable.</p>
<p>The <code>frac [base]</code> command takes the item on the top of the stack (<code>line1</code>) and displays the fractional equivalent.  <code>[base]</code> sets the percision of the calculation. If a <code>base</code> is not provided, RPNCalc will use 1/64 as the default.</p>
<p><strong>For example</strong>, if you had <code>1.1234</code> on the stack, <code>frac</code> would show you <code>1.1234 is approximately 1 1/8</code>  So base was given so it would have used a base of 64 (which means maximum granularity would be 1/64) and auto reduced the result which is why you get the <code>1 1/8</code>. </p>
<p>if <code>frac 2</code> woulc have been entered (which means 1/2 is maximum granularity), you get <code>1.1234 is approximately 1 0/1</code> or just one.  <em>Need to look into that display oddity</em>.|</p>

<h1 id="user-defined-functions"><a class="header" href="#user-defined-functions">User Defined Functions</a></h1>
<p>RPNCalc can record your commands and save them as a user defined function.  In essence, you are creating a new command that can be run.</p>
<p>When recording a new function, start by adding data to your stack that would emulate when you would run your function.  The only data that will be part of your recording will be data &amp; commands entered <em><strong>after</strong></em> recording has been turned on.  When you are ready, enter the <code>record on</code> command.  A red <code>[Recording]</code> alert will appear in the status line. Anything you add during this period will be recorded with the exception of the commands listed below.  Enter your commands, numbers, etc. until you are done.</p>
<p>When recording is complete, enter <code>record off</code> to complete your recording.  You'll be prompted for a function name.  Your new command will be this name so choose a name without spaces and that is easy to type when you wish to execute the function in the future.  You should also not choose a name of an existing command as your function will not be able to be called.  If you do not provide a name, i.e, just hit enter, the recording will be discarded.</p>
<p>Then you can run your function whever you like on the stack currently available.  To run the function, simply type the name of your function as a standard command. To see a list of the saved functions, execute <code>list func</code> and it will display the name and the steps you recorded.</p>
<p>User defined functions can be deleted with the <code>func del NAME</code> command or you can delete all of the functions with <code>func delall</code></p>
<p>Functions are global and can work across any stack.  They are saved in the preferences system and will be reloaded when RPNCalc starts.  They are saved immediatly after you give a new recording a name and press enter.</p>
<p>When you execute a function, the steps of that function are executed one after the other.  Therefore when you execute <code>undo</code> you will undo back through your function step by step. You do not <code>undo</code> the entire function in one command.  Of course you can always run <code>undo NUM</code> where num is the steps to undo.</p>
<p>The following commands can be entered during a recording, but are not recorded.</p>
<ul>
<li>frac</li>
<li>list</li>
<li>debug</li>
<li>ver, version</li>
<li>help, h, ?</li>

<p>Operational commands are commands that do not directly impact your stack numbers. These tend to be display commands or those the interact with the the setting of RPNCalc directly.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Command</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>list stacks</td><td>List the current saved stacks on the system, including the one currently in use</td></tr>
<tr><td>list mem</td><td>Display the contents of the memory slots</td></tr>
<tr><td>list undo</td><td>Displays all of the saved stacks and their contents used for undo operations.  Basically what your stack will look like when you perform an undo.  These are not saved between RPNCalc executions</td></tr>
<tr><td>list func</td><td>Show a list of the defined User Defined Functions (UDF) and the steps within each one</td></tr>
<tr><td>load NAME</td><td>Load the named stack.  You can <code>load</code> a stack name even if it doesn't exist, and it will be created. This is how a new stack is created and is similar to using the <code>-l name</code> command line switch. Exiting the program or loading another stack will save the current stack before switching</td></tr>
<tr><td>import FILENAME</td><td>With <code>import</code> RPNCalc will replace the current stack with one loaded from a file.  The file format is simple, just one number per line.  Do not include any comments or alphanumeric/special characters.  Just one number per line with the last number being <code>line1</code> - just like the display in RPNCalc</td></tr>
<tr><td>ss</td><td>Swap the current stack with the secondary. The primary and secondary stacks are described in the Stacks section.  Executing <code>ss</code> again will swap them back.  The secondary stack it just a place to do a bit of other work then you can swap back.  They are in no way connected.  The secondary stack is also saved upon exit</td></tr>
<tr><td>debug</td><td>Toggle debug mode which will display additional information on what's happening internally in the program.  Same as the <code>-D</code> command line switch.  Probably not the useful for a normal user</td></tr>
<tr><td>a l <br> a d <br> a r</td><td>Align the display output to be <code>l(eft)</code>, <code>d(ecimal)</code>, or <code>r(ight)</code>.  This is the same as the <code>-a &lt;l, d, r&gt;</code> command line switch</td></tr>
<tr><td>ver</td><td>Display the current version number and copyright as well as the latest GitHub release.  This is equivalent to the <code>-v</code> command line option.  Users of Snap installations will automatically be up to date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>h <br> ?</td><td><code>h</code> or <code>?</code> will display the in-program help page</td></tr>
<tr><td>cx</td><td><code>cx</code> will clear the stack and then exit the program</td></tr>
<tr><td>x <br> exit</td><td><code>x</code> or <code>q</code> will exit the program.  The primary stack, secondary stack, and memory slots will be saved upon exit</td></tr>

<h1 id="building-rpncalc-from-the-source"><a class="header" href="#building-rpncalc-from-the-source">Building RPNCalc from the Source</a></h1>
<p>RPNCalc is written in Java and uses <a href="https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html">Maven</a> as it's build tool (although I am starting to look at <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a> which seems more flexible).  To build, you'll need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.  Make sure you get the JDK and not the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which most people would have on their machines.  The JRE allows you to run Java applications, but not build them. At the time of this writing, you'll need Java 11 or newer.</p>
<p>After the JDK is installed, you'll need to install the Apache Maven build tool.  Then download/clone of the source code from Github along with my <a href="https://github.com/frossm/library">library package</a>.  This library package contains many methods that I use across my applications.</p>
<p>To install the library, execute the following from the top level library directory (the one with the <code>pom.xml</code> file in it):</p>
<p><code>mvn install</code></p>
<p>That should install the library into the Maven cache on your computer.</p>
<p>Secondly, you'll need to build the executable RPNCalc jar file.  From the top level directory of RPNCalc, execute:</p>
<p><code>mvn package</code></p>
<p>Assuming all goes well, you'll have a new shiny <code>rpncalc.jar</code> file in the <code>target</code> directory.</p>
<p>I'll discuss this more in the Snap chapter, but if you are on a Linux system that supports snaps, I would encourage that you leverage it. Not only are Snap applications &quot;sandboxed&quot; so it's secure, all of the dependencies are bundled in so you don't even need to have java installed on the machine. It is also automatically updated so you'll always have the latest. You can force this with <code>sudo snap refresh</code>.</p>
<p>My preference is to use the Snap installation which is what I do on my Ubuntu machines.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="snap"><a class="header" href="#snap">SNAP</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://snapcraft.io/rpncalc"><img src="https://snapcraft.io//rpncalc/badge.svg" alt="rpncalc" /></a></p>
<p>I would encourage anyone with a supported Linux platform to use the Snap package of RPNCalc.  You can learn more about Snap from the <a href="https://snapcraft.io">Snapcraft Homepage</a>.</p>
<p>At a high level, a Snap is a fully contained container with your application and it's dependencies bundled in.  It runs in a <code>sandbox</code> so it can't interfere with other parts of your system until it's given access.  Snaps are automatically kept up to date and are easily removed leaving no trace on the system.  There is even a nice <a href="https://snapcraft.io/store">App Store</a> where you can find software. </p>
<p>As an example, RPNCalc uses Java, but you don't have to have Java installed on your machine as it's bundled in with the Snap.</p>

<p>As a shameless plug, you can <a href="https://snapcraft.io/search?q=fross">Search for 'Fross'</a> to see all of my Snap packages.</p>
<p>While I'm a fan of Snaps, there are positives and negatives to using them.</p>
<h2 id="snap-the-good-and-the-bad"><a class="header" href="#snap-the-good-and-the-bad">Snap: The Good and the Bad</a></h2>
<p><em><strong><center>-- Thanks to the good folks at MakeUseOf.com for this! --</center></strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-snap-and-snap-store/">MakeUseOf.com</a> has a good breakdown of everything that's good and bad about Snap.</p>
<p>Ever since Canonical announced Snap, there's been a stir in the Linux community about whether Snap is the right approach to improve package distribution on Linux. This has given rise to two opposing camps: one in favor of Snap and the other critical of its approach in the long run.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of everything that's good and bad about Snap.</p>
<h3 id="advantages-of-using-snap"><a class="header" href="#advantages-of-using-snap">Advantages of Using Snap</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Snaps come bundled with dependencies (libraries) that facilitate instant access to a program, as you no longer have to manually install the missing dependencies to make it work on your system.</li>
<li>Each snap runs in its own containerized sandbox to avoid interference with other system packages. As a result, when you remove a snap, the system removes all of its data, including dependencies, without affecting other packages. Needless to say, this also offers a more secure environment since one package can't access the information of another.</li>
<li>Snap updates snaps automatically at set intervals. Hence, you always run the latest version of a program on your system.</li>
<li>Snap makes it easier for developers to distribute their software directly to users, so they don't have to wait for their Linux distribution to roll them out.</li>
<li>Adding to the previous point, another advantage of putting developers in charge of packaging and distributing their software is that they don't have to create distro-specific packages, as it comes bundled with the required dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages-of-snap"><a class="header" href="#disadvantages-of-snap">Disadvantages of Snap</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Since snaps come bundled with dependencies, they're larger in size and occupy more disk space than their counterparts from other package managers.</li>
<li>As a result of the bundled dependencies, snaps are distributed as compressed filesystem images and you need to mount them first before installing. Because of this, snaps are slower to run than traditional packages.</li>
<li>Although Snap enables developers to distribute their snaps directly to users, the distribution pipeline requires them to set up an account with Canonical and host their snaps on it. This goes against the true nature of the open-source methodology because even though the software is still open source, the package management system is controlled by an entity.</li>
<li>Another downside to allowing developers to distribute packages is that the packages don't go through stringent checks and reviews by the community and therefore carry the risk of containing malware---as seen a few years back.</li>
<li>Due to the fact that Snap's back-end is still closed-source and controlled by Canonical, many major Linux distros aren't on board with the idea of putting Snap as the default package manager on their system.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="wrapup"><a class="header" href="#wrapup">Wrapup</a></h1>
<p>Well, if you've read this far you probably know more about RPNCalc than I do.  I needed a command line based RPN calculator and have been very happy with this one.  I've added features as I've needed them and use it daily for many years now.  Some time ago I decided to make the program, source, and documentation available so others could use it if they wished.  For those that have, I hope you found it useful.</p>
<p>I'll continue to add new features as I think about them.  If you have suggestions, issues, or ideas, the links to reach out to me are on the Introduction page.</p>
<p>Best wishes and happy calculating...</p>
